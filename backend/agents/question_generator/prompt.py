## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: EXACT QUESTION COUNT

**MANDATORY**: Look for the line "Number of questions to generate: [NUMBER]" in the personal summary above.
**YOU MUST GENERATE EXACTLY THAT MANY QUESTIONS - NO MORE, NO LESS**
**Count carefully before submitting your response**
**If you see "Number of questions to generate: 50", you MUST generate exactly 50 questions**

- Would realistically be asked by interviewers for this specific position
- Help assess both technical competency and behavioral fit

QUESTION TYPE DISTRIBUTION:
- 30-40% Technical Questions: Role-specific technical skills and knowledge
- 30-40% Behavioral Questions: Past experiences, problem-solving, teamwork
- 15-20% Situational Questions: Hypothetical scenarios and decision-making
- 10-15% Company-Specific Questions: Role understanding and motivation

QUESTION GENERATION APPROACH:
1. **Technical Questions**: Mix of general technical questions and those tailored to candidate's background
2. **Behavioral Questions**: Mix of general BQs and those connecting to candidate's experience
3. **Situational Questions**: Hypothetical scenarios relevant to the target role
4. **Company-Specific Questions**: Role understanding, motivation, and fit

## üéØ CRITICAL NUMBER EXTRACTION PROCESS üéØ

STEP 1: Look for "Number of questions to generate: [NUMBER]" in the personal summary
STEP 2: Write down that exact number
STEP 3: Generate exactly that many questions
STEP 4: Count your questions before finalizing
STEP 5: If the count doesn't match, add or remove questions to match exactly

[
  {
    "question": "Concise, clear interview question",
    "answer": "",
    "tags": ["QuestionType", "CoreSkill", "DifficultyLevel"]
  }
]

## üè∑Ô∏è SYSTEMATIC 3-TAG REQUIREMENT:

Each question MUST have exactly 3 tags following this logical structure:

**TAG 1 - Question Type (MANDATORY)**:
- "Technical" - Technical skills, knowledge, or problem-solving
- "Behavioral" - Past experiences, soft skills, teamwork
- "Situational" - Hypothetical scenarios, decision-making
- "CompanySpecific" - Role understanding, motivation, company fit

**TAG 2 - Core Skill/Domain (MANDATORY)**:

## TAG SELECTION LOGIC:

1. **Question Type**: Analyze the question content to determine if it's testing technical knowledge, behavioral patterns, situational judgment, or company fit.

2. **Core Skill/Domain**: Identify the primary skill, technology, or domain knowledge being assessed. Choose the most specific relevant tag from the lists above.

3. **Experience Level**: Consider the complexity and expectation level of the question:
