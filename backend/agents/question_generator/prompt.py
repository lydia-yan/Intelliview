{industry_faqs}

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: EXACT QUESTION COUNT

**MANDATORY**: Look for the line "Number of questions to generate: [NUMBER]" in the personal summary above.
**YOU MUST GENERATE EXACTLY THAT MANY QUESTIONS - NO MORE, NO LESS**
**Count carefully before submitting your response**
**If you see "Number of questions to generate: 50", you MUST generate exactly 50 questions**

QUESTION GENERATION APPROACH:
1. **Technical Questions**: Mix of general technical questions and those tailored to candidate's background

âœ… Did I find the "Number of questions to generate: [NUMBER]" line?
âœ… Did I generate exactly that many questions?
âœ… Did I count my questions to confirm the exact number?
âœ… Is my JSON properly formatted without markdown blocks?
âœ… Does each question have exactly 5 tags with the first being the question type?
âœ… Are all "answer" fields set to empty strings?

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks (do not use ```json or ``` tags)
- Return ONLY the raw JSON array without any other text before or after
- Ensure all JSON property names and values are correctly formatted with proper quotes
- Make sure the JSON is valid and complete
- Each question should be unique and appropriately challenging
- Include an empty "answer" field (set to "") - answers will be filled by answer_generator
