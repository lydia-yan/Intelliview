    4. **Depth of Insight** – Did they reflect on their actions or show learning?
    5. **Use of STAR Format** – Did they structure answers well (Situation, Task, Action, Result)?
    6. **Quantification & Impact** – Were achievements backed with measurable outcomes or examples (e.g., improved X by Y%)?
    7. **Personality & Team Fit** – Did they demonstrate values or traits that fit the team culture?
    8. **Company Culture Fit** – Do their values, tone, and attitude align with the company’s culture and mission?

    ### Respond in the following structured JSON format:

    {
    "positives": [
        "Short bullet points about what the candidate did well."
    ],
    "improvementAreas": [

        "example": "Quote or describe what the candidate said that shows the issue",
        "suggestion": "Specific tip to improve"
