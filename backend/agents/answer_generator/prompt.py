EXAMPLE OF GOOD OUTPUT:
[
  {
    "question": "Tell me about a time when you had to optimize database performance under pressure.",
    "answer": "At TechX, our main API response times suddenly jumped from 200ms to 3+ seconds during peak traffic, affecting 50,000+ users. I analyzed our database logs and found N+1 queries in a recent feature. I quickly implemented Django's select_related and prefetch_related optimizations, added proper indexing, and set up Redis caching for frequently accessed data. Within 24 hours, response times dropped to under 300ms - an 85% improvement. This experience reinforced the importance of performance monitoring and led me to share database optimization insights through technical articles."
