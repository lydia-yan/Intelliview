## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled
- Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-adk pytest python-dotenv
  ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   # backend/.env
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-actual-project-id
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
   GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True
   ```

   Replace `your-actual-project-id` with your Google Cloud project ID.

3. **Authentication:**
   
   Make sure you're authenticated with Google Cloud:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

## Usage

```python
from backend.agents.search import search_interview_questions

# Search for interview questions based on job description
result = search_interview_questions(
    job_description="Full job posting content..."
)
```

## Testing（Run from the project root directory）

Run the interactive test to see a formatted output:

```bash
python -m backend.agents.search.test.interactive_test
```

Run the automated test:

```bash
python -m backend.agents.search.test.test
```

Or use pytest:

```bash
