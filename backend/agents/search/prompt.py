GOAL: Based on the job title and job description provided above, search the Internet for the most common interview questions (general questions + interview experiences) for this specific job position.

Please use the job title and job description to:

1. SEARCH FOR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: Use the google_search tool to search for common interview questions and real interview experiences related to the specified job position. Perform multiple searches to gather comprehensive information:
   - Search for general interview questions for the position

   - Search for interview experiences from real candidates
   - Search for industry-specific questions
   - Search for behavioral questions commonly asked for this role
   - If company is mentioned in job title or job description, include company-specific information

2. ORGANIZE THE RESULTS: Structure your findings into distinct categories of questions, with clear examples for each category.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use the job title and job description provided above as the basis for all searches
- Conduct a minimum of 5 different searches to gather comprehensive information
- Use search queries that include the job title, industry, and experience level mentioned in the job description

- For technical roles, include technical questions and coding challenges
- Include information about interview processes and formats when available
